Swift Tasker is a micro-tasking platform enabling users to complete small tasks for rewards, managed through distinct roles for task creators, workers, and admins.

## Here are three features of this project.

- **Role-based Task Management:** Swift Tasker supports distinct roles such as Workers, Task-Creators, and Admins, each with tailored functionalities for efficient task creation, completion, and platform administration.

- **Reward System:** Users earn rewards by completing tasks, fostering engagement and incentivizing participation within the platform.

- **Secure Transactions:** The platform ensures secure transactions and data handling, maintaining user trust and confidentiality throughout task interactions.
